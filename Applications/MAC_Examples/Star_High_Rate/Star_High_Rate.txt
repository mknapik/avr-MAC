MAC Example - Star_High_Rate


Brief Description

The MAC Example Star High Rates deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network transmitting frames from the device to the
Coordinator using high rates (i.e. Mbit/s).

Switch on node one; LED 0 indicates that the node has started properly.
Flashing of LED 1 indicates that the node is scanning its environment.
Scanning is done three times on each available channel depending on the radio type.
If no other network with the pre-defined channel and PAN Id is found,
the node establishes a new network at the pre-defined channel (channel 20 for 2.4GHz radio).
The successful start of a new network is indicated by switching LED 1 on.

Switch on the other node;LED 0 indicates that the node has started properly.
Flashing of LED 1 indicates that the node is scanning its environment.
Scanning is again done three times on each available channel depending on the radio type.
If a proper network is discovered, the node joins the existing network and indicates a successful association by switching on LED 1.

Every two seconds this nodes sends out a dummy data packet using high rate (2MBits/s).
If the packet is acknowledged by the other node the LED 2 is flashing.
