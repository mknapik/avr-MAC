MAC Example for 802.15.4 - Promiscuous Mode Demo


Introduction
============
This example is based on the MAC layer API implementing a network diagnostic tool by using the promiscuous mode as described in IEEE 802.15.4-2006 (section 7.5.6.5 Promiscuous Mode).

Build Information
=================
The firmware for the MAC example "Promiscuous Mode Demo" can be created in three ways: Using the corresponding Makefile directly, executing the Makefile from the AVR Studio or building it from the IAR EWW.
Only one node type is actually involved in this example. It is recommended to use another application (e.g. MAC_Star_Nobeacon) in conjunction on the same channel in order verify the proper functioning of this demo.

During the build process the switch PROMISCUOUS_MODE is enabled.

Requirements
============
This application requires a serial connection for proper demonstration of the promiscuous mode. Depending on the available Serial I/O interface for each board this can be either UART or USB (see corresponding Makefiles or IAR project files). In order to see the output of the application please start a terminal application on your host system.

Implementation
==============
The application works as follows:
1) The node performs a reset of the stack (wpan_mlme_reset_request()).
2) After successful processing of the reset, the channel for operation can be entered by the user
3) Afterwards the promiscuous mode is switched on immediately.
4) In the serial terminal on the host system printouts indicate the detected hardware (radio and microcontroller), set channel and channel page, and the status of promiscuous mode.
5) Now the application will print each received frame (that has a valid CRC) on the terminal. In order to limit the load on the serial connections, currently only the following items are displayed:
- Number of received frame
- Type of frame
- Content of frame (received octets in hexadecimal form), this includes the MAC Header (MHR) of the original frame and the payload within this frame.
6)In the application itself the received frame is already parsed so that the variable app_parse_data contains all information for the MAC header (i.e. addressing information) of the received frame already in a structure of type prom_mode_payload_t.

Note:
In case the build switch "HIGH_DATA_RATE_SUPPORT" is set within in the Makefiles or IAR project files, the channel page can also be entered
by the user. This allows for using the application also for high rates.
