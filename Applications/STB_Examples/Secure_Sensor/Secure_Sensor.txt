Secure Sensor


Brief Description

The basic STB Example Secure_Sensor deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network with encrypted and authenticated frames. The data sink (coordinator) starts a PAN at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID. The sensor (device) scans for this network and associates to the data sink (coordinator). Once the sensor (device) is associated, it uses a timer that fires every 2 seconds to transmit a random payload (sensor measurement data) to the data sink.

For demonstration purposes the coordinator's configuration is limited to associate two devices at maximum.


The frames are secured according to ZigBee/CCM* network layer security:
- The network header is omitted, only the auxiliary security header is constructed (14 byte long).
- The applied security level is 0x06, i.e. encrypted payload, authentication applied, MIC 8 byte long.
- The random payload has 13 byte length.


LED signals:

- Both nodes:
  - LED 0 on: Application is running.

- Sensor (Device):
  - LED 1 on: Sensor (Device) is associated to Data Sink (Coordinator).
  - LED 2 blinking slowly: Data frames are sent (one every 2 seconds).

- Data Sink (Coordinator):
  - LED 1 on: Network is started.
  - LED 2 blinking slowly: Data frames are received (one every 2 seconds).
  - LED 0 blinking fast: Format error on received frame - wrong payload length, or security control byte has a wrong value.
  - LED 1 blinking fast: Frame with too small frame counter received.
  - LED 2 blinking fast: MIC of received frame is wrong.
