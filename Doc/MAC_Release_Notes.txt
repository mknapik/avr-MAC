Known issues
- AVR GCC tool chain for Xmega: library bug with printf functionality
- Firmware that is larger than 64k created with WinAVR-20080610 GCC for ATxmega128A1 shows undefined behavior; e.g. 32 MHz oscillator cannot be enabled. In the current Xmega WinAVR tool chain (version WinAVR-20080610) there is a bug for images larger than 64k size. This will be fixed by setting the ramp Z register to 0 at program start. Once the tool chain is fixed this shall be removed.
- printf functionality provided by WinAVR-20080610 release used with ATxmega128A1 causes undefined behavior. This has impact to example applications, like Performance_Test.

Early Radio Extender Boards (REB) version 5.0 might have external EEPROM values stored in the wrong format.
